      <description>Description The program uses an artifical Recurrent Nerual Network (RNN) called Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) to predict the closing stock price of a corporation, like Apple Inc. using the past 60 day stock price.
Firstly, we import the library for computation processing. We get the stock quote from the website Yahoo using web.DataReader(), specifying the start date and end date of data extraction. Then we show the dataframe by commaning df, which comprises of 2270 rows (a day for a row), and 6 columns (Hig, Low, Open, Close, Volume, Adjusted Close).</description>

      <description>Description Quantum computer operating in superconducting qubits can go to the temperature of nearly absolute 0 degree Kelvin. It takes a huge operating cost to build and maintain its superpower. Unless you are a scientist or an engineer in an advacned reseach group or a big company like IBM, Google, Microsoft, you cannot have a taste of what it&amp;rsquo;s going on physically. It would be wonderful if you could run it on your hands.</description>

      <description>Description This is a project using pandas to analyse the sales productivity. By means of data analysis, we can answer the following questions:
What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?   It makes sense that December is the best month of sales, becasue it is the period of Christmas and public holidays. People tend to buy presents for celebration.
What city sold the most product?</description>

      <description>I have been working on quantum machine learning by implementing gradient descent for optimized parametrized circuits using pennylane and qiskit, this can tremendously improve the cost and also simplify the quantum gate. The Jupyter Notebook file may be too large so you need to reload it again.
Description Implement a circuit that returns |01&amp;gt; and |10&amp;gt; with equal probability. Requirements :The circuit should consist only of CNOTs, RXs and RYs. Start from all parameters in parametric gates being equal to 0 or randomly chosen.</description>
